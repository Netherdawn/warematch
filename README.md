## Getting Started

We're using npm here boyos; no yarn or pnpm allowed but it would be best if we switched to those package managers, esp as the package numbers increase

First,

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## CREDENTIALS

The credentials for authorization need to be added to the 
`AUTH_EMAIL` and `AUTH_PASS` constants as applicable in the page.tsx

this really should be in a config set up with the config on the git ignore
